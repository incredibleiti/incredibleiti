## Hi there 👋 Welcome to my Profile. 
I’m a <b>Certified Software Architect cum Engineering Manager </b> with a passion for problem-solving—both in the real world and the coding world. I'm proficient in C++, C, Java, PHP, Python, and C#.
How come? I began my career with C# (and still use it during hackathons), but for the past 7 years, I’ve been working primarily with C++.

I regularly switch between domains and languages thanks to my curiosity, pattern recognition skills, and drive to solve complex problems. While this versatility sometimes confuses Applicant Tracking Systems, I’ve stayed committed to doing the kind of work I love.

Currently, I’m working with C++11/14/17, Java, and Python on software projects for Volkswagen's electric and petrol vehicle platforms. I’m also skilled in Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins, and CMake.

In addition to my technical role, I’m active as an IT Consultant, and I mentor and coach teams—leveraging my social and people management skills to bridge cultural gaps and build stronger engineering communities.
I am currently associated with Rotterdam Women in Tech, SheCanCode, GirlCode Netherlands.

I’m open to leadership roles and collaboration opportunities—especially those involving architecture or technical management. Happy to connect over Microsoft Teams!
